## **How to Contribute or simply familiarize yourself with this theory**

We invite **physicists, mathematicians, engineers, and open-science advocates** to refine and expand this framework:

1. **Verify the Simulations** – Run the provided Python scripts alongside another simulation of 𝜓 without the memory integral. Compare how 𝜓 evolves over time in both cases.Extend 𝐾(𝑡−𝑡′)K(t−t ′) to match physical memory effects in real-world systems. and compare results to simulations made with potentially higher understanding. 

2. **Improve the Mathematical Model** – Test additional constraints, variables, and refinements, confirm the constancy and reason of the math.

3. **Apply to Experimental Physics** – Design lab experiments to detect memory-field effects throughout common sciences from all the things we have concidered 'pseudo science' that may related to memories accumulation and resonance.

4. **Expand the Theory** – Explore applications in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and consciousness studies as these system would likely depend on the memories of the world as this predicts we could fool the world's memories to our advantage under the right circumstances.

Memory-Driven Physics: Practical Applications and Understanding
**The first questions Many would have**
*What Are Those Memories?*
*From a common understanding*: Memories are a "reactionary form" that plays part in dictating the form of future shapes of various systems of relationship. It is a system that reacts in a transmutation of the 'acquired energy' of what the physical realm perceives as decay (or a loss then becomes this increase in potential within a system being a valid interpretation) in order to remember what WAS and is BEING transformed including ITSELF which is why I refer to this as a SHAPE to begin with. MEMORIES are the CAUSE of causality's system that relies on this previous relationship in order to then become a fundemantal. Once enough systems participates in it. Time becomes the consequences of the cyclical nature of these systems that Transmute losses into a form that influences the potentital within future transmutations leading to transformations.

*In the context of Memory-Driven Physics*: Memories are not simply stored past events but fundamental structures that influence and shape physical reality. These memories exist as persistent information imprints, governing interactions at all scales, from subatomic particles to macroscopic structures. They serve as a framework for continuity, affecting the behavior of systems by retaining informational influence beyond mere material existence.

How Do They Interact With the World?

Memories in this framework interact with the world by guiding the evolution of physical systems. Unlike traditional models where forces act independently in an instantaneous manner, Memory-Driven Physics suggests that past states contribute directly to present dynamics. This means that every interaction carries a history, influencing motion, transformation, and emergent behavior (seen most easily in living beings that are conscienciously using this system) The world is not only shaped by current conditions but also by accumulated informational imprints that structure probability, causality, and energy distributions.

**Understanding Memories Beyond a Consequence of Life**

While biological memory is often seen as a byproduct of neural activity, Memory-Driven Physics extends the concept beyond living systems. Memories are understood as an intrinsic part of reality, encoding past states into the fabric of existence. This challenges the view that memory is solely a function of cognition and instead posits that physical reality itself is a record of past interactions, continually shaping the present like the grooves of a vinyl guids the needle to produce its recorded sounds until it TOO decays.

**Applying the Formula and Reading It Correctly**

The formula within Memory-Driven Physics represents the integration of memory imprints into physical equations. To apply it:

*Identify the system's history, understanding how past states influence the current configuration.* The memory and will component Ie. Light has the will of a constant vibration recorded within the medium of the displaced protons, its memories. Then figuring out the Y component as to finalize the Power-Frequency-Y system which in the case of light would be 0.7 as it emerges from previous systems that were themselves consequences seen by the need for light to possess both a medium and a vibration to be while matter and vibrations requires Energy and frequencies giving rise to a chain of causality within the physical world explored in documents like:

-Incorporating memory-driven terms into conventional models, ensuring that prior influences are quantitatively included allowing the simulations to account for memories without having to place bodies in specific organizations, they would likely structure themselves more closely to what we observe in reality then our current models which should be compiled in 📂 Experiments\

-Interpret the results by acknowledging the layered nature of reality, where present phenomena are the sum of accumulated past interactions rather than solely the result of immediate forces.

-Interpreting the formula requires an understanding of how time, space, and information interplay dynamically within this new system. Unlike static equations and 'flat causality', Memory-Driven Physics introduces a persistent element where past conditions remain embedded in the system, influencing present calculations in a non-trivial way depending on the power and frequency of said systems.

-By integrating these principles, the theory offers new pathways to understanding complex systems, from quantum mechanics to large-scale cosmological structures, fundamentally altering how we perceive causality and the evolution of physical phenomena and bringing greater accuracy to the behavior of the world in simulation.

**Understanding the Equation in Its Pure Form**

To fully grasp the equation used in Memory-Driven Physics, it is essential to break it down step by step, starting from its raw form and gradually adding layers of complexity. The fundamental components of the equation serve specific roles in describing how memory interacts with physical reality.

**The Raw Form or The foundational equation used for simulations**

dψ/dt = iĤψ + ∫[−∞, t] K(t - t')ψ(t') dt'

*where ψ represents the system's state vector 
Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator encapsulating total energy
K(t - t') is the memory kernel, characterizing past states' influence on the present rate of change dψ/dt.

*Time (t) as a Vortex of Filament, a consequence of the accumulation of memories* 
Time is treated as a structured vortex, guiding the flow of interactions. This ensures past influences persist, shaping the system’s evolution through the convolution integral K(t - t'), incorporating all past states ψ(t') up to the present t.

**Constraints The equation follows to maintain physical consistency**

*Normalization Condition*: ⟨ψ | ψ⟩ = 1, preserving total probability.

*Causality Enforcement*: K(t - t') vanishes for t' > t, ensuring future states do not affect the present.

*Adding Complexity*: Non-Local Influence & Feedback Loops

*Non-Locality*: Extending K(t - t') to include spatial dependencies allows past events at different locations to influence the present, introducing non-local effects.

*Feedback Mechanisms*: The equation can be modified to include feedback loops where past responses shape future behavior, leading to emergent phenomena.

-By breaking down the equation in this manner, we gain a clear understanding of how memory fields integrate into physical systems, offering a novel perspective bridging multiple domains of physics.
