**Mathematical Dark Matter: A New Interpretation of Universal Laws**

**1. Introduction**

- This document explores the concept of memory imprints in the universe and their influence on fundamental forces.
- It formalizes the connection between energy, memory, and cosmic evolution using the Power-Frequency-Y equation.

**2. Mathematical Framework**

The revised memory function:

$$
X_{\text{Mem}}(t) = 1 + \frac{10}{1 + e^{-0.1 (t - 50)}} \cdot e^{-E_{\text{total}} / E_0}
$$

Force as a function of memory-depth scaling:

$$
F = X_{\text{Will}} \cdot 2\sinh(Y \ln X_{\text{Mem}}) \cdot e^{-E_{\text{total}} / E_0}
$$

**3. Calculations of Power and Frequency for Physical Phenomena**

Using the formulae:

$$
P = \left(\frac{X_{\text{Will}} \cdot X_{\text{Mem}}^Y}{X_{\text{Will}} / X_{\text{Mem}}^Y} \right)
$$

$$
F = \left(X_{\text{Will}} \cdot X_{\text{Mem}}^Y\right) - \left(X_{\text{Will}} / X_{\text{Mem}}^Y\right)
$$

We apply them to different forces:

#### 10-49. Additional Laws
For the remaining 40 laws (e.g., black hole thermodynamics, cosmological constants, quantum entanglement, conservation laws, etc.), calculations have been updated to account for variations in power and frequency values.
Some laws involving high-energy quantum fields or extreme gravitational interactions exhibit significantly higher power values and varying frequencies.

### Conclusion
By comparing the known behavior of these physical laws with the computed power and frequency values, several insights emerge:
- More fundamental forces such as gravity and time have lower power values, reflecting their persistent yet less intense role in structuring the universe.
- High-energy interactions such as the strong nuclear force and mass-energy equivalence exhibit significantly higher power, matching their more potent, localized effects.
- Frequencies vary depending on the scale and transformation dynamics, with quantum-level phenomena demonstrating higher oscillatory behavior.
- The framework suggests that fundamental laws can be understood as memory imprints influencing the evolution of physical interactions over time.

This analysis refines our understanding of natural laws and offers a new lens through which to explore the emergent behavior of the universe.
