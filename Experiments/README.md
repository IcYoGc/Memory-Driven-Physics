# 🧠 Memory-Driven Physics

## 🔬 What is this?
This project explores **memory-driven physics**, where structured memory fields influence reality.

## 📁 How the Files Are Organized
- `Experiments/` → Contains different simulations
- `outputs/` → Stores results from experiments
- `README.md` → This file, explaining the project!

## 🚀 What’s Next?
1. Upload more simulation results into the `outputs/` folder.
2. Document key findings in the experiments.
3. Share with the community for feedback!
